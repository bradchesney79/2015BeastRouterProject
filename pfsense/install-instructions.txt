So the command to load pfsense onto USB install medium for me was:

dd if=/path/pfSense-memstick-2.2.4-RELEASE-amd64.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512

Let's break this down, the if is your input file; the of is your output file-- my USB drive happens to be device sdb; and bs keeps the program from copying one bit at a time, it makes the copy happen faster.

You want the block device and not a partition so that you write the master boot record as well as the primary partition.


You boot from the USB, it will give you the option to install pfSense-- which went well.

pfSense is based on FreeBSD-- without QCA9880 802.11ac driver support. As of yet there doesn't seem to be a good FreeBSD "ath10k equivalent" driver...

Disqualified...
