# 2015BeastRouterProject

My very reliable and happiness-inducing router began to fail-- It originally cost me $140 brand new. It met 70% of my hopes and dreams regarding a home router for myself as a power user and my family.

I got curious, how much would I have to spend to get everything I want? If 70% cost ~$140, then 100% should cost $200 or so. Nope. Turns out ~$400.

The parts list is available here and on my blog.

I've started with OpenWRT to see how far I can get and what I can accomplish with it.

Next is pfSense.

Lastly, I would like to try IPFire.

And I welcome anyone to contribute and/or benefit from this endeavor. (Currently need help with OpenWRT configuration.)
